GLYPH is a prototype first-person exploration/shooter engine rendered entirely from Japanese characters, where architecture, interface, and environment collapse into a single typographic field. Space is not modelled but written: but glyphs are stripped not only of their usual semantic function but also of pictorial realism. In the manner of Tuymans, the world instead operates through the implied and the withheld rather than depiction. Depth, scale, and motion are indirectly suggested and implied - through shifts in glyph size, density, and colour, never fully declared. Feedback introduces afterimages and temporal smearing, further refusing spatial clarity and instead accumulating over time. Reading and navigation become inseparable acts, unfolding through partial visibility, delay, and inference rather than definite depictions.
